Gandor Dialogue Expansion (Phase 3.1)

Summon Responses:
"The veils part, and I am here."
"What knowledge do you seek in this fleeting moment?"
"Your voice echoes through the Nexus. Speak."
"I sense a disturbance. What is your query?"
"The threads of fate shift. What do you require?"
"From the depths, I listen."
"The echoes respond. What do you wish to know?"
"The ancient ones watch. What is it?"
"I am here, but for how long?"
"The Nexus calls, and I answer."

Idle Comments:
"The air hums with forgotten energies."
"Time is a river, always flowing."
"Secrets lie hidden in the shadows."
"The stars whisper of forgotten realms."
"The walls of the Nexus hold many stories."
