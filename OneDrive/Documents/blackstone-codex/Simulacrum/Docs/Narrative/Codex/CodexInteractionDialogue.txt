Codex Interaction Dialogue:

"The Codex reveals fragments of a forgotten age."
"These symbols hold secrets best left undisturbed."
"The Nexus remembers... and it shares its memories."
"Seek understanding, but tread carefully."
"The echoes of the past resonate within these pages."
"This knowledge is a burden, not a gift."
"The truth is a labyrinth, and these are its threads."
"The Codex reflects the shifting nature of reality."
"Listen closely, and you may hear the whispers of time."
"The past is not dead; it is merely waiting."
